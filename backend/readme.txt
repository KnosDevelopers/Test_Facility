This folder holds the files for the backend. You can directly push to this folder as it
is in the 'developement' branch of the project.

After git pull, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to automatically download all the modules neccessary to run the code we just wrote.

Only members of the backend team should be pushing code to this folder.

Thank you,
Knos Devs.
